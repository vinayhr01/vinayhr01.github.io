            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-white title-font mb-2">What is the difference between web development &
              web design? </h2><br>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-white title-font mb-2" style="text-decoration: underline;">Answer:-
              <br> <br> </h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">Well, this is the greatest confusion which is quite tricky to get rid of
              especially when you are thinking of designing a website for your business. Most of the business owners get
              addled amongest these terms for the full construction of a website. <br> <br>

              Basically, it occurs due to the lack of the knowledge regarding the development of the website. If you are
              in similar situation and are preparing to develop a site then you should do a thing first. <br> <br>

              It is pivotal to know the basic difference between web design and web development because by this way you
              can know the elements which are significant to leverage in the site at the correct time. <br> <br>

              This also let you understand the job role of a web developer and web designer as well. So, you can
              accompany them to the fullest in finishing the project in the specific deadline and that too in an
              appropriate manner. Now the differentiation between these two is clearly stated in the following for your
              reference: <br> <br>
              1) Web development refers to the process of functionality creation and usability testing.<br> <br>

              2) Web design refers to the appearance and content creation.<br> <br>

              Web design is all about transformation of an attractive idea in visually impressive design. Rather
              simplicity, its integration is quite difficult at all. It monitors the overall look, feel and appearance
              of
              the site maintaining the user experience at the same time. Graphic designing, logo designing, branding,
              placement of Call-to-Actions and selection of colour palettes are also included in it. <br> <br>

              On the other hand, Web development is classified into numerous stacks such as Fullstack, Backend and
              Frontend. Fullstack is represented as the combined tasks of both backend and frontend. Backend relates the
              functional development of site- the ways in which a site is supposed to function or perform. <br> <br>

              It is done with the proper usages of backend development programming languages and platforms such as Perl,
              Python, Java and PHP. Frontend is the layout of the site created by the web developers. This is made
              visible
              to the users and allows them to interact! Some famous codes writing platform used to serve this purpose
              are
              JavaScript, CSS and HTML. <br> <br>

              Hope, now you have clearly understood the key difference within these two and could set out for the
              designing and development of your commercial or business website. Just make sure that you have chosen a
              reliable, professional and dedicated team of developers and designers to do the job. Also, you may contact
              with the leading web development company in India for so as well.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium text-white title-font mb-2">Is it better to be a Web Designer or Web
              Developer?</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">I agree with those that say being both is definitely better. <br> <br>

              But being a designer is not easier. <br> <br>

              Coding is finite; once you learn the code, the code doesnâ€™t change (not counting new advances in
              technology, which happen relatively slowly).</p>
